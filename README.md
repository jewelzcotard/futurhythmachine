Atlantic futurism is always building Futurhythmachines, sensory technologies, instruments which renovate perception, which synthesise new states of mind... Seeping in from the futurepast, it feeds forward into the present, anachronising everything it reaches. Assembled from molecular components of rhythm, the Breakbeat is an Applied Rhythmic Technology, an ART that sets cultural velocity and cultural inertia in motion.
